# workoutcounter
This project is in development and it is still buggy.
More features and commented explain is on the way.

When you cover a part of your workout tool with blue and then workout with it infront of your camera it will count the appearances.
If it counted, it will wait for 2.5 seconds and then continue.

Basically how this works is...


Features to come:
-Reset button
-After a specific number, it will play a sound(to remind you've completed the set of repetitions)
-Better GUI
-Color options

-you will enter the sets and repetitions you have to do and this software will inform you by changing colors and playing sounds
  and you can enter the rest times in between too
